# python-2
My Python-2 Repo for SkilStak Coding arts.

The main focus of this repo is the Text Based Engine based off of "Pokemon"
It is likely that the project will not be finished but the repo will stay up
for reference on later projects.

The "Battle" file was not made in python-2. I just want this up on
github. Most likely will strip the game and keep it as a text based
battle engine for Project: AlphaQuest
